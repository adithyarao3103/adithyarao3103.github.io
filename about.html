I am Adithya, and I am a physicist.<br>I am a masters' degree holder from <a href="https://www.svnit.ac.in/"  target="_blank"  >NIT Surat</a> with a specialisation in Physics.<br>

<u><i>My favourite activity involves indulging in the exquisite art of contemplation, as I dive into the innermost workings of the universe at its tiniest scales, surrendering to the cosmic ballet that dances upon the subatomic stage.</i></u> would be a fancy way of telling that my field of interest is Quantum Field Theories and Quantum Gravity. <br>
I am currently working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory" target='_blank'   >Quantum Field Theories of Strongly Interacting Fields</a>. These theories with their rich mathematics, and beautiful geometries are hugely unexplored owing to their complexity, and here I am, already neck deep in these uncharted waters. At the same time I am also studying computational methods including lattice field theory, to aid progress in this field.<br><br> 

My awe for the universe doesn't make me less sensitive to the other stuff in the world. I am wowed by the capabilities of the man-made machine educated in only 0s and 1s, but capable of comprehending the universe. Depending on my mood, you might see me coding, sketching, or you might also find me contemplating on Indian Philosophy, trying to make sense of the absurdity of the reality we live in and battling existential crisis that follows.
