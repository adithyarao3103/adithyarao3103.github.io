So far I was working on my master's thesis, on the topic of Gribov Ambiguity and Stochastic Quantization under the guidance of <a href="https://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/spip/spip.php?page=member2&lang=en" target="_blank"  >Dr Laurent Baulieu</a>. <br>
<!-- The standard procedure for quantizing gauge fields is the Faddeev-Popov quantization, which performs gauge fixing in the path integral formulation and introduces ghost fields. This approach provides the foundation for calculations in quantum Yang-Mills theory. However, Gribov showed that the procedure was incomplete, with residual gauge copies (called Gribov copies) still present in the path integral. These copies impact the infrared behavior of the theory and modify gauge-dependent quantities. Furthermore, their existence breaks down the Faddeev-Popov prescription at a fundamental level. <br>
If you did not understand it, don't worry. Just think that the gauge theory has copies which had to be removed but the standard procedure for removing them doesn't work perfectly.<br> -->
Previously I have also worked with <a href="https://www.physik.uni-jena.de/en/bergner" target="_blank"  >Dr Georg Bergner</a> as a DAAD WISE exchange student at <a href="https://www.uni-jena.de/en" target="_blank"  >Jena University</a> on Lattice Simulations of BFSS model. I have also undertaken many other projects, you can find the details in the CV. <br><br>
<b>My future research plan</b><br>
I am looking for a doctoral position in theoretical physics. Presently I am studying quantum simulations, data analysis using ROOT and DL-ML. <br><br>

<b>My Skills</b><br>
Theoretical Physics, Lattice Gauge Theory Simulations, Machine learning and Data Analysis.<br> 
C++, C, FORTRAN, Python, LaTeX, Mathematica, MATLAB, ROOT, etc.
